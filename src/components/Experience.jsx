        Ever since I was young I always loved tinkering with the social media platforms such as Xanga where I designed my own HTML and searched for cool music play boxes to embedd on my sites. Since then technology had always excited me and kept me current with tech. My dive into web development didn't fully happen until I met a software engineer in Taiwan. He explained to me how powerful JavaScript and the React library can be and the many doorways software engineering can open up. Thats when I started to immerse myself deeper into coding by playing with flappy bird browser game tutorials, website design classes from code academy and introduction classes on JavaScript through youtube. My hunger to learn grew a step further when  I challenged myself on taking a coding prep course from App Academy which reinforced me with a deeper understanding in JS functions, algorithms, and problem solving. My journey snowballed into joining an extensive three month boot camp through General Assembly and I was taught technology trends and practiced strong team cooperation. With this fulfilling experience I have become well equipped and confident on embracing new tech and building full stack apps everyday.

        My time at Verizon has been valuable and cultivating. This company has equipped me with the skills to adapt to constantly changing environments and to think quickly and effectively when faced with day to day challanges. I guess that was why they gave us the title Solutions Specialist, because we were always on our toes and had to be comfortable solving problems when we see them. This previous role had prepared me well when I first started to enter the tech/development scene because I again faced day to day challenges and it took a lot of patience and diligence to overcome hurdles that came my way. What I also valued from this previous work experience was the reinforcing of my communication skills by connecting to my customers and being able to professionally attend to their needs and concerns. While working in sales or in tech, soft skills are highly needed to successfully complete daily tasks and agendas. This is why Verizon to me was a valuable stepping stone and also a boon to my current role now, as a full-stack web developer.
